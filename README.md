## About
This application builds on top of [WebDHT](https://github.com/SnowyCoder/wdht) and [WebTorrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent) to build a live-watching platform, you can both upload video files and watch them together with your friends while being syncrhonized, or you can share a video source and stream directly.

This has been developed to demonstrate the usage of WebDHT to build real-world projects, as such it is more elaborate than most example applications, but it will not become much more complex.
